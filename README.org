** Making My Music Download interactive

The python script i last made to download the music from mio.to was designed in such a way that it download songs when the album link
was given . Because then it was to Download all the music from the site and an interactive interface was not required .
The list.py created a list of all the movies in a perticular category and shell scripting was used to automatically download
all the music from this list . Now I think that it should be made interactive , so  I changed the script to and added the ebility 
to search from their site and crab the link of the search result . python have an -i option which executes all the code in the file
and gives a interactive shell.  

there are three funtion new() , search_album() , download()

new() -- load the new music from Hindi Malayalam and Tamil Category

search_album() -- takes a string as argument and searches the string in mio.to and loads the top five result 

download()  -- shows all the loaded link and promt for the index number of the movie to be downloaded


a global variable is declared to to store the the result of new() and search_album() then calling 
download to download any of the loaded link

#+BEGIN_SRC 
python3 -i mio_Interactive.py
#+END_SRC

to list all the new release 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> new()
#+END_EXAMPLE

to search an album 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> search_album("Aashiqui")
#+END_EXAMPLE

to download the one from the list
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>>> download()
#+END_EXAMPLE
